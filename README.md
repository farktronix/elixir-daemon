# HLTE

Work-in-progress rewrite of the current `go` daemon in elixir, while also removing much of the cruft from an older, now-dead usage model.

Use [`tools/keygen`](https://github.com/hlte-net/tools/blob/main/keygen) to create an appropriate key file and get the hexadecimal representation needed for the extension's settings.
